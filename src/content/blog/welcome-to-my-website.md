## A Little About Myself

Let me give you a glimpse into who I am.

My name is Ankur Kumar,
I was born in Hyderabad, where my journey into the world began.

As an ex-Kendriya Vidyalaya student, I completed my high school education from Bagdogra West Bengal, Nal Bikaner, and AFA Dundigal Hyderabad where I laid the foundation for my academic journey.

## What To Expect From This Blog ?

### Mobile Application Development using Flutter

My exploration began with Dart and Flutter, where I delved into the realm of mobile app development. From crafting sleek user interfaces to implementing complex functionalities, I honed my skills in creating immersive mobile experiences.

I can offer insights on optimizing app performance, troubleshooting common issues, and leveraging Flutter's extensive widget library to build stunning UIs. Additionally, I'll share practical tips on **structuring Flutter** projects using **Domain Driven Design** And **Clean Architecture** Principles, **managing state** effectively using libraries like **BloC** and **Riverpod**, and integrating third-party packages for added functionality. I can also help you get your first app published to Google Playstore.

Whether you're a beginner looking to get started or an experienced developer seeking advanced techniques, I'm here to guide you through your Flutter journey.

### API Development In Python

From Flutter then **transitioning to Python** and FastAPI **opened up new possibilities** in the realm of backend development. Building robust APIs became second nature as I navigated the intricacies of asynchronous programming and data serialization. And as the web continued to evolve, so did my toolkit.

With FastAPI, I've tackled a variety of projects, from simple CRUD APIs to more complex systems requiring **authentication**, **data validation**, and integration with external services. Its seamless integration with tools like Pydantic for data validation and **SQLAlchemy for database** interactions has made it a powerful ally in my journey as a backend developer.

### Web Development

After building apps and APIs, I realized the **importance of having an online presence** and **marketing** to reach users. This led me to dive into web development, drawing from my past experience with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.

I began my journey with **NEXT.js**, attracted by its popularity and the seamless integration with **Vercel**. However, as I delved deeper into **SEO** and **Site Performance**, I found NEXT.js sometimes struggled to achieve optimal page speed results, despite its smooth development experience and robust ecosystem.

Seeking alternatives, I explored **Astro** and **Qwik**. Qwik, similar to NEXT.js but with a twist, intrigued me with its **concept of resumability** and the promise of consistently **high page speed** scores by loading **JavaScript only when needed**.

On the other hand, [**Astro**](https://astro.build/) caught my attention for its suitability for smaller to medium-sized websites, offering static site generation with SSR features and an exceptionally **smooth developer experience**. And Even gives **better Page Speed** Performance than other two. Astro also introduces [**Islands architecture**](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands) which results in better frontend performance by helping you **avoid monolithic**. **Island architecture allows your to use Qwik, React, Svelte, Vue frameworks in Astro**. [Read more about Astro Island](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands)

In my web development journey, I utilized various **libraries for styling**, including **Tailwind CSS**, **Shadcn**, **MantineUI**, and **DaisyUI**. Among them, I found Tailwind CSS, especially when paired with DaisyUI, to be particularly effective and enjoyable to work with. Its utility-first approach and extensive set of pre-built components streamlined my workflow and allowed for greater flexibility in crafting visually appealing web projects.

### Microservices Architecture, gRPC and Rest API Development

Before delving deeper into backend development, I faced the crucial **decision** of **selecting** the primary programming **language** to focus on. With options like C/C++, Rust, Go, Python, and TypeScript/JavaScript on the table, I weighed the **pros and cons** carefully.

Despite the vast ecosystem and popularity of JavaScript, I prioritized speed, simplicity, and maintainability. While I had some exposure to C and C++ during my education, I found them complex and challenging to manage effectively. Rust, though promising, felt relatively new and less established.

**Ultimately, I opted for Go**, and it was love at first code. Go felt like the perfect blend of TypeScript and Dart, offering a **balance** of ease of learning, **blazing-fast performance**, **simplicity**, **used by many**, **huge libs ecosystem** and **backed by Google**. Within a week, I was already smitten with its **elegant syntax** and **powerful features** like **concurrency**.

And for the past two years, I've been fully immersed in the world of Go. Embracing **microservices architecture**, **gRPC**, and asynchronous workers, I've had the opportunity to tackle **complex** challenges head-on and build **scalable**, resilient systems.

With microservices, I've embraced the idea of **breaking down monolithic** applications into **smaller**, more **manageable** components, each responsible for a **specific task** or **functionality**. This modular approach not only promotes **flexibility** and **scalability** but also enhances **fault isolation** and **system resilience**.

### Headless Stack, Databases And Tools

Throughout my journey, I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of databases and CMS tools, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Firebase, Supabase, Appwrite, Directus, WordPress, and Strapi.

Exploring headless stacks and CMS platforms has further enriched my skill set, allowing me to tackle a diverse range of projects with confidence and versatility.

### From Windows To Linux

I used to be a Windows user, familiar with customizing the interface and managing the system. However, Windows often held me back. I didn't appreciate the automatic updates, the tedious software installation process (downloading .exe files from websites and following setup wizards), unexpected errors, warnings, glitches, and of course, the infamous Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).

Programming on Windows was particularly frustrating. The constant switching between mouse and keyboard for various tasks required a lot of manual effort and slowed down my workflow.

So, I decided to make a change and started with an Ubuntu-based distro called Pop!\_OS by System76. The experience was incredibly smooth. Debian/Ubuntu's extensive package support impressed me, and I was amazed by Pop!\_OS's keyboard bindings and tiling window manager.

Within a month, I was blown away by what Linux could do. The freedom and control over the system were phenomenal. This led me to try several other distros, including _Linux Mint, Fedora, Manjaro, EndaevourOS, and NixOS._

Out of all these, I liked Manjaro the most. It offered a great balance of usability and features. After a long run with Manjaro, I eventually moved on to EndeavourOS, opting for a minimal setup with no desktop environment. This allowed me to build my own desktop environment using a tiling window manager like bspwm and Hyprland.

For the past two years, I've been using **Arch Linux with Hyprland**, a **tiling window manager** based on Wayland, which I find superior to Xorg. I write my own **scripts** to make my Linux **workflow smooth and automated**. You can check out my [dotfiles on my GitHub](https://github.com/sirjager/dotfiles).

In addition to this transition, I switched from VSCode to Neovim as my primary editor. While VSCode often required too much mouse usage, was resource-hungry, and sometimes lagged on my system, **Neovim** offered a **faster**, more **keyboard-centric** experience. With **custom keybindings** and **extensive plugins**, Neovim has been my go-to editor for over a year and a half. I even built my **own Neovim configurations** from scratch, tailored to my workflow. Neovim has proven to be a fantastic tool, **enhancing** my coding **efficiency** and **comfort**.

Switching to Arch Linux was one of the best decisions I made. The flexibility, control, and efficiency it provides have significantly improved my productivity and overall experience.
